## Why OpenRefine?
Anyone who has worked with large or historic datasets will know that standardizing data can be more time consuming and difficult than the actual analysis. OpenRefine is a free software that allows users to efficiently clean and transform their datasets, allowing for more time spent on meaningful analysis and less spreadsheet headaches.
