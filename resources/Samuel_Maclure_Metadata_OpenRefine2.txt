Two different proposals for additions and alterations to three-storey house with basement.

The architect specifies stone veneer over all wall surfaces, encasing the original wood-frame structure. New interior partitioning results in the following arrangement: The first floor comprises a hall, drawing room, music room, living room, dining room, cloak room and adjoining water closet, smoking room, billiard room, safe, kitchen, pantry, larder, servants' hall, two servants' rooms and bathroom.

The second proposal (plans AP466-AP469), dated July 1910, prescribes the addition of a two-storey wing and a three-storey wing. The finish of the additions is to match that of the old building as far as possible. This may represent the plan to turn Burleith into a luxury hotel. The first floor consists of a vestibule, hall, drawing room, music room, den, billiard room, dining room, kitchen, pantry, larder, servant's room, fifteen bedrooms, three bathrooms and three water closets.

Plans, elevations and details are represented in most projects. Additions to a two-storey house with basement and various new outbuildings on the grounds. A wing adds a trunk room in the basement, and a laundry on the ground floor. The roof of the latter forms a balcony off the boys' sleeping room on the second floor. Plans specify a rubble stone basement wall and wood-frame walls finished with roughcast. Another addition extends the maid's bedroom and adds a bathroom and closet over the porte cochere. Another bathroom is later added above this extension connecting with the boys' room. Two further second-floor bedrooms are added next to the boys' room (possibly above the first addition described above). A large terrace with rubble stone walls is added across the breadth of the east side of the house, and quarter-turn stairs descend from it. The terrace turns the northeast corner of the house and is surrounded by a two-storey structure next to the laundry addition. A new second-floor bedroom with lavatory and closet is built above a loggia on the ground floor or terrace level. Two sketch plans show wall, window and fireplace treatment of a living room extension. Outbuildings include five different proposals for a garden tea house, two designs for a change house, two proposals for garage additions and a large cruciform greenhouse with attached aviary. This house was originally designed for Judge Peter Secord Lampman in 1905 by F.M. Rattenbury and built in 1907-08. P.L. James and Hubert Savage designed further additions in 1930. Includes four sets of specifications (AP119-AP122). Contractors' signatures on various plans include Leggett & Girardeau (per. H. Leggett) and Hunter & Halket (per E.J. Hunter)."

Two different proposals for additions and alterations to three-storey house with basement. The first proposal (drawings AP457-AP465), dated October 1907, calls for a new veranda and extensions to the front, right side and rear. The architect specifies stone veneer over all wall surfaces, encasing the original wood-frame structure. New interior partitioning results in the following arrangement: The first floor comprises a hall, drawing room, music room, living room, dining room, cloak room and adjoining water closet, smoking room, billiard room, safe, kitchen, pantry, larder, servants' hall, two servants' rooms and bathroom. The second floor consists of ten bedrooms, four bathrooms, boudoir, dressing room, linen room and safe. The third floor includes seven bedrooms, two bathrooms, sewing room, trunk room and balcony. The second proposal (plans AP466-AP469), dated July 1910, prescribes the addition of a two-storey wing and a three-storey wing. The finish of the additions is to match that of the old building as far as possible. This may represent the plan to turn Burleith into a luxury hotel. The first floor consists of a vestibule, hall, drawing room, music room, den, billiard room, dining room, kitchen, pantry, larder, servant's room, fifteen bedrooms, three bathrooms and three water closets.

Plans, elevations and details are represented in most projects. Additions to a two-storey house with basement and various new outbuildings on the grounds. A wing adds a trunk room in the basement, and a laundry on the ground floor. The roof of the latter forms a balcony off the boys' sleeping room on the second floor. Plans specify a rubble stone basement wall and wood-frame walls finished with roughcast. Another addition extends the maid's bedroom and adds a bathroom and closet over the porte cochere. Another bathroom is later added above this extension connecting with the boys' room. Two further second-floor bedrooms are added next to the boys' room (possibly above the first addition described above). A large terrace with rubble stone walls is added across the breadth of the east side of the house, and quarter-turn stairs descend from it. The terrace turns the northeast corner of the house and is surrounded by a two-storey structure next to the laundry addition. A new second-floor bedroom with lavatory and closet is built above a loggia on the ground floor or terrace level. Two sketch plans show wall, window and fireplace treatment of a living room extension. Outbuildings include five different proposals for a garden tea house, two designs for a change house, two proposals for garage additions and a large cruciform greenhouse with attached aviary.

"1 of 13 drawings: 7 blueprints, 6 lithographs; 71 x 73 cm or smaller"	architectural drawings AAT	Still Image	eng	"Plans and elevations. Two different proposals for additions and alterations to three-storey house with basement. The first proposal (drawings AP457-AP465), dated October 1907, calls for a new veranda and extensions to the front, right side and rear. The architect specifies stone veneer over all wall surfaces, encasing the original wood-frame structure. New interior partitioning results in the following arrangement: The first floor comprises a hall, drawing room, music room, living room, dining room, cloak room and adjoining water closet, smoking room, billiard room, safe, kitchen, pantry, larder, servants' hall, two servants' rooms and bathroom. The second floor consists of ten bedrooms, four bathrooms, boudoir, dressing room, linen room and safe. The third floor includes seven bedrooms, two bathrooms, sewing room, trunk room and balcony. The second proposal (plans AP466-AP469), dated July 1910, prescribes the addition of a two-storey wing and a three-storey wing. The finish of the additions is to match that of the old building as far as possible. This may represent the plan to turn Burleith into a luxury hotel. The first floor consists of a vestibule, hall, drawing room, music room, den, billiard room, dining room, kitchen, pantry, larder, servant's room, fifteen bedrooms, three bathrooms and three water closets. The second floor contains 26 bedrooms, dressing room, seven bathrooms and a writing room. The third floor comprises twelve bedrooms and three bathrooms."

"Additions & alterations to ""Burleith"" for Hon. James Dunsmuir"	"Item is an architectural drawing by Samuel Maclure prepared for James Dunsmuir of Victoria, B.C."	"Maclure, Samuel, 1860-1929"	Architecture	1907-1910	"Burleith, 743 Craigflower Road, Victoria, B.C."	"1 of 13 drawings: 7 blueprints, 6 lithographs; 71 x 73 cm or smaller"	architectural drawings AAT	Still Image	eng	"Plans and elevations. Two different proposals for additions and alterations to three-storey house with basement. The first proposal (drawings AP457-AP465), dated October 1907, calls for a new veranda and extensions to the front, right side and rear. The architect specifies stone veneer over all wall surfaces, encasing the original wood-frame structure. New interior partitioning results in the following arrangement: The first floor comprises a hall, drawing room, music room, living room, dining room, cloak room and adjoining water closet, smoking room, billiard room, safe, kitchen, pantry, larder, servants' hall, two servants' rooms and bathroom. The second floor consists of ten bedrooms, four bathrooms, boudoir, dressing room, linen room and safe. The third floor includes seven bedrooms, two bathrooms, sewing room, trunk room and balcony. The second proposal (plans AP466-AP469), dated July 1910, prescribes the addition of a two-storey wing and a three-storey wing. The finish of the additions is to match that of the old building as far as possible. This may represent the plan to turn Burleith into a luxury hotel. The first floor consists of a vestibule, hall, drawing room, music room, den, billiard room, dining room, kitchen, pantry, larder, servant's room, fifteen bedrooms, three bathrooms and three water closets. The second floor contains 26 bedrooms, dressing room, seven bathrooms and a writing room. The third floor comprises twelve bedrooms and three bathrooms."

Two further second-floor bedrooms are added next to the boys' room (possibly above the first addition described above). A large terrace with rubble stone walls is added across the breadth of the east side of the house, and quarter-turn stairs descend from it.

"1 of 13 drawings: 7 blueprints, 6 lithographs; 71 x 73 cm or smaller"	architectural drawings AAT	Still Image	eng	"Plans and elevations. Two different proposals for additions and alterations to three-storey house with basement. The first proposal (drawings AP457-AP465), dated October 1907, calls for a new veranda and extensions to the front, right side and rear. The architect specifies stone veneer over all wall surfaces, encasing the original wood-frame structure. New interior partitioning results in the following arrangement: The first floor comprises a hall, drawing room, music room, living room, dining room, cloak room and adjoining water closet, smoking room, billiard room, safe, kitchen, pantry, larder, servants' hall, two servants' rooms and bathroom. The second floor consists of ten bedrooms, four bathrooms, boudoir, dressing room, linen room and safe. The third floor includes seven bedrooms, two bathrooms, sewing room, trunk room and balcony. The second proposal (plans AP466-AP469), dated July 1910, prescribes the addition of a two-storey wing and a three-storey wing. The finish of the additions is to match that of the old building as far as possible. This may represent the plan to turn Burleith into a luxury hotel. The first floor consists of a vestibule, hall, drawing room, music room, den, billiard room, dining room, kitchen, pantry, larder, servant's room, fifteen bedrooms, three bathrooms and three water closets. The second floor contains 26 bedrooms, dressing room, seven bathrooms and a writing room. The third floor comprises twelve bedrooms and three bathrooms."

Plans, elevations and details are represented in most projects. Additions to a two-storey house with basement and various new outbuildings on the grounds. A wing adds a trunk room in the basement, and a laundry on the ground floor. The roof of the latter forms a balcony off the boys' sleeping room on the second floor. Plans specify a rubble stone basement wall and wood-frame walls finished with roughcast. Another addition extends the maid's bedroom and adds a bathroom and closet over the porte cochere. Another bathroom is later added above this extension connecting with the boys' room. Two further second-floor bedrooms are added next to the boys' room (possibly above the first addition described above). A large terrace with rubble stone walls is added across the breadth of the east side of the house, and quarter-turn stairs descend from it. The terrace turns the northeast corner of the house and is surrounded by a two-storey structure next to the laundry addition. A new second-floor bedroom with lavatory and closet is built above a loggia on the ground floor or terrace level. Two sketch plans show wall, window and fireplace treatment of a living room extension. Outbuildings include five different proposals for a garden tea house, two designs for a change house, two proposals for garage additions and a large cruciform greenhouse with attached aviary. This house was originally designed for Judge Peter Secord Lampman in 1905 by F.M. Rattenbury and built in 1907-08. P.L. James and Hubert Savage designed further additions in 1930. Includes four sets of specifications (AP119-AP122). Contractors' signatures on various plans include Leggett & Girardeau (per. H. Leggett) and Hunter & Halket (per E.J. Hunter)."

Two different proposals for additions and alterations to three-storey house with basement. The first proposal (drawings AP457-AP465), dated October 1907, calls for a new veranda and extensions to the front, right side and rear. The architect specifies stone veneer over all wall surfaces, encasing the original wood-frame structure. New interior partitioning results in the following arrangement: The first floor comprises a hall, drawing room, music room, living room, dining room, cloak room and adjoining water closet, smoking room, billiard room, safe, kitchen, pantry, larder, servants' hall, two servants' rooms and bathroom. The second floor consists of ten bedrooms, four bathrooms, boudoir, dressing room, linen room and safe. The third floor includes seven bedrooms, two bathrooms, sewing room, trunk room and balcony. The second proposal (plans AP466-AP469), dated July 1910, prescribes the addition of a two-storey wing and a three-storey wing. The finish of the additions is to match that of the old building as far as possible. This may represent the plan to turn Burleith into a luxury hotel. The first floor consists of a vestibule, hall, drawing room, music room, den, billiard room, dining room, kitchen, pantry, larder, servant's room, fifteen bedrooms, three bathrooms and three water closets.

Plans specify a rubble stone basement wall and wood-frame walls finished with roughcast. Another addition extends the maid's bedroom and adds a bathroom and closet over the porte cochere. Another bathroom is later added above this extension connecting with the boys' room. Two further second-floor bedrooms are added next to the boys' room (possibly above the first addition described above). A large terrace with rubble stone walls is added across the breadth of the east side of the house, and quarter-turn stairs descend from it. The terrace turns the northeast corner of the house and is surrounded by a two-storey structure next to the laundry addition. A new second-floor bedroom with lavatory and closet is built above a loggia on the ground floor or terrace level. Two sketch plans show wall, window and fireplace treatment of a living room extension. Outbuildings include five different proposals for a garden tea house, two designs for a change house, two proposals for garage additions and a large cruciform greenhouse with attached aviary. This house was originally designed for Judge Peter Secord Lampman in 1905 by F.M. Rattenbury and built in 1907-08. P.L. James and Hubert Savage designed further additions in 1930. Includes four sets of specifications (AP119-AP122). Contractors' signatures on various plans include Leggett & Girardeau (per. H. Leggett) and Hunter & Halket (per E.J. Hunter)."

The sun room on the ground floor is reconstructed and transformed into a drawing room, and the bedroom adjacent to it is converted into a den. The enlarged space on the second floor above the new drawing room becomes two bedrooms, and the two bathrooms and linen room are relocated. The contract drawings for the first alteration (AP1628-AP1635) are stamped and inscribed: ""This one of the drawings referred to in our agreement dated Nov. 12th 1925.

Two different proposals for additions and alterations to three-storey house with basement. The first proposal (drawings AP457-AP465), dated October 1907, calls for a new veranda and extensions to the front, right side and rear. The architect specifies stone veneer over all wall surfaces, encasing the original wood-frame structure. New interior partitioning results in the following arrangement: The first floor comprises a hall, drawing room, music room, living room, dining room, cloak room and adjoining water closet, smoking room, billiard room, safe, kitchen, pantry, larder, servants' hall, two servants' rooms and bathroom. The second floor consists of ten bedrooms, four bathrooms, boudoir, dressing room, linen room and safe. The third floor includes seven bedrooms, two bathrooms, sewing room, trunk room and balcony. The second proposal (plans AP466-AP469), dated July 1910, prescribes the addition of a two-storey wing and a three-storey wing. The finish of the additions is to match that of the old building as far as possible. This may represent the plan to turn Burleith into a luxury hotel. The first floor consists of a vestibule, hall, drawing room, music room, den, billiard room, dining room, kitchen, pantry, larder, servant's room, fifteen bedrooms, three bathrooms and three water closets.

Plans, elevations and details are represented in most projects. Additions to a two-storey house with basement and various new outbuildings on the grounds. A wing adds a trunk room in the basement, and a laundry on the ground floor. The roof of the latter forms a balcony off the boys' sleeping room on the second floor. Plans specify a rubble stone basement wall and wood-frame walls finished with roughcast. Another addition extends the maid's bedroom and adds a bathroom and closet over the porte cochere. Another bathroom is later added above this extension connecting with the boys' room. Two further second-floor bedrooms are added next to the boys' room (possibly above the first addition described above). A large terrace with rubble stone walls is added across the breadth of the east side of the house, and quarter-turn stairs descend from it. The terrace turns the northeast corner of the house and is surrounded by a two-storey structure next to the laundry addition. A new second-floor bedroom with lavatory and closet is built above a loggia on the ground floor or terrace level. Two sketch plans show wall, window and fireplace treatment of a living room extension. Outbuildings include five different proposals for a garden tea house, two designs for a change house, two proposals for garage additions and a large cruciform greenhouse with attached aviary.

The blueprints of the original building show some alterations sketched in. Two-storey house with basement. In the original house design (1908) the basement includes a servant's room, coal and wood bin and a laundry room. The ground floor is comprised of a hall with adjoining lavatory, drawing room, library, dining room, kitchen, pantry, larder and two verandas. The second floor contains three bedrooms, a dressing room, two bathrooms and a balcony. The wood-frame construction is finished in half timbering on the second floor. The ground-floor exterior treatment is not specified in this drawing set, but the plans of the later alterations (see below) call for shingles here. The basement is stone. Leaded glass is specified for many second floor windows. The alterations of 1913 extend the back of the house and call for the development of the attic as a usable living space. On the ground floor the library is considerably enlarged, and a coat room, lavatory and servant's room are installed. The southeast veranda is extended forward bringing it flush with its mate on the other side of the house, and both are enclosed in glass all around. A partially glassed-in archway between the two verandas leads in to the stairway to the porch. Second-floor alterations include conversion of the northwest bedroom to a work room and the addition of a sleeping balcony, bathroom, alcove and bedroom. The rear stairway is extended to the attic, which is opened by the addition of three dormers. A drying room and play room occupy this space. The original exterior treatment of the house is maintained on the additions and alterations."

Plans, elevations and details are represented in most projects. Additions to a two-storey house with basement and various new outbuildings on the grounds. A wing adds a trunk room in the basement, and a laundry on the ground floor. The roof of the latter forms a balcony off the boys' sleeping room on the second floor. Plans specify a rubble stone basement wall and wood-frame walls finished with roughcast. Another addition extends the maid's bedroom and adds a bathroom and closet over the porte cochere. Another bathroom is later added above this extension connecting with the boys' room. Two further second-floor bedrooms are added next to the boys' room (possibly above the first addition described above). A large terrace with rubble stone walls is added across the breadth of the east side of the house, and quarter-turn stairs descend from it. The terrace turns the northeast corner of the house and is surrounded by a two-storey structure next to the laundry addition. A new second-floor bedroom with lavatory and closet is built above a loggia on the ground floor or terrace level. Two sketch plans show wall, window and fireplace treatment of a living room extension. Outbuildings include five different proposals for a garden tea house, two designs for a change house, two proposals for garage additions and a large cruciform greenhouse with attached aviary. This house was originally designed for Judge Peter Secord Lampman in 1905 by F.M. Rattenbury and built in 1907-08. P.L. James and Hubert Savage designed further additions in 1930. Includes four sets of specifications (AP119-AP122). Contractors' signatures on various plans include Leggett & Girardeau (per. H. Leggett) and Hunter & Halket (per E.J. Hunter)."

The architect specifies stone veneer over all wall surfaces, encasing the original wood-frame structure. New interior partitioning results in the following arrangement: The first floor comprises a hall, drawing room, music room, living room, dining room, cloak room and adjoining water closet, smoking room, billiard room, safe, kitchen, pantry, larder, servants' hall, two servants' rooms and bathroom. The second floor consists of ten bedrooms, four bathrooms, boudoir, dressing room, linen room and safe. The third floor includes seven bedrooms, two bathrooms, sewing room, trunk room and balcony. The second proposal (plans AP466-AP469), dated July 1910, prescribes the addition of a two-storey wing and a three-storey wing. The finish of the additions is to match that of the old building as far as possible. This may represent the plan to turn Burleith into a luxury hotel. The first floor consists of a vestibule, hall, drawing room, music room, den, billiard room, dining room, kitchen, pantry, larder, servant's room, fifteen bedrooms, three bathrooms and three water closets.

The blueprints of the original building show some alterations sketched in. Two-storey house with basement. In the original house design (1908) the basement includes a servant's room, coal and wood bin and a laundry room. The ground floor is comprised of a hall with adjoining lavatory, drawing room, library, dining room, kitchen, pantry, larder and two verandas. The second floor contains three bedrooms, a dressing room, two bathrooms and a balcony. The wood-frame construction is finished in half timbering on the second floor. The ground-floor exterior treatment is not specified in this drawing set, but the plans of the later alterations (see below) call for shingles here. The basement is stone. Leaded glass is specified for many second floor windows. The alterations of 1913 extend the back of the house and call for the development of the attic as a usable living space. On the ground floor the library is considerably enlarged, and a coat room, lavatory and servant's room are installed. The southeast veranda is extended forward bringing it flush with its mate on the other side of the house, and both are enclosed in glass all around. A partially glassed-in archway between the two verandas leads in to the stairway to the porch. Second-floor alterations include conversion of the northwest bedroom to a work room and the addition of a sleeping balcony, bathroom, alcove and bedroom. The rear stairway is extended to the attic, which is opened by the addition of three dormers. A drying room and play room occupy this space. The original exterior treatment of the house is maintained on the additions and alterations."

Plans, elevations and details are represented in most projects. Additions to a two-storey house with basement and various new outbuildings on the grounds. A wing adds a trunk room in the basement, and a laundry on the ground floor. The roof of the latter forms a balcony off the boys' sleeping room on the second floor. Plans specify a rubble stone basement wall and wood-frame walls finished with roughcast. Another addition extends the maid's bedroom and adds a bathroom and closet over the porte cochere. Another bathroom is later added above this extension connecting with the boys' room. Two further second-floor bedrooms are added next to the boys' room (possibly above the first addition described above). A large terrace with rubble stone walls is added across the breadth of the east side of the house, and quarter-turn stairs descend from it. The terrace turns the northeast corner of the house and is surrounded by a two-storey structure next to the laundry addition. A new second-floor bedroom with lavatory and closet is built above a loggia on the ground floor or terrace level. Two sketch plans show wall, window and fireplace treatment of a living room extension. Outbuildings include five different proposals for a garden tea house, two designs for a change house, two proposals for garage additions and a large cruciform greenhouse with attached aviary.

The ground floor comprises a vestibule and adjoining cloak room and lavatory, stair hall, hall, drawing room, sun room, dining room, kitchen, butler's pantry and two bedrooms. A large veranda extends across the front of the house. The second floor contains five bedrooms, linen room, two bathrooms and a water closet. The alteration plans proposed in 1928 call for the construction of a flower room, play room and storeroom in the basement. The sun room on the ground floor is reconstructed and transformed into a drawing room, and the bedroom adjacent to it is converted into a den. The enlarged space on the second floor above the new drawing room becomes two bedrooms, and the two bathrooms and linen room are relocated. The contract drawings for the first alteration (AP1628-AP1635) are stamped and inscribed: ""This one of the drawings referred to in our agreement dated Nov. 12th 1925. [Signed] Horace Leggett, Adrien Emile Girardeau [and][ J de Suzannet""."

Plans, elevations and details are represented in most projects. Additions to a two-storey house with basement and various new outbuildings on the grounds. A wing adds a trunk room in the basement, and a laundry on the ground floor. The roof of the latter forms a balcony off the boys' sleeping room on the second floor. Plans specify a rubble stone basement wall and wood-frame walls finished with roughcast. Another addition extends the maid's bedroom and adds a bathroom and closet over the porte cochere. Another bathroom is later added above this extension connecting with the boys' room. Two further second-floor bedrooms are added next to the boys' room (possibly above the first addition described above). A large terrace with rubble stone walls is added across the breadth of the east side of the house, and quarter-turn stairs descend from it. The terrace turns the northeast corner of the house and is surrounded by a two-storey structure next to the laundry addition. A new second-floor bedroom with lavatory and closet is built above a loggia on the ground floor or terrace level. Two sketch plans show wall, window and fireplace treatment of a living room extension. Outbuildings include five different proposals for a garden tea house, two designs for a change house, two proposals for garage additions and a large cruciform greenhouse with attached aviary. This house was originally designed for Judge Peter Secord Lampman in 1905 by F.M. Rattenbury and built in 1907-08. P.L. James and Hubert Savage designed further additions in 1930. Includes four sets of specifications (AP119-AP122). Contractors' signatures on various plans include Leggett & Girardeau (per. H. Leggett) and Hunter & Halket (per E.J. Hunter)."

Plans, elevations and details are represented in most projects. Additions to a two-storey house with basement and various new outbuildings on the grounds. A wing adds a trunk room in the basement, and a laundry on the ground floor. The roof of the latter forms a balcony off the boys' sleeping room on the second floor. Plans specify a rubble stone basement wall and wood-frame walls finished with roughcast. Another addition extends the maid's bedroom and adds a bathroom and closet over the porte cochere. Another bathroom is later added above this extension connecting with the boys' room. Two further second-floor bedrooms are added next to the boys' room (possibly above the first addition described above). A large terrace with rubble stone walls is added across the breadth of the east side of the house, and quarter-turn stairs descend from it. The terrace turns the northeast corner of the house and is surrounded by a two-storey structure next to the laundry addition. A new second-floor bedroom with lavatory and closet is built above a loggia on the ground floor or terrace level. Two sketch plans show wall, window and fireplace treatment of a living room extension. Outbuildings include five different proposals for a garden tea house, two designs for a change house, two proposals for garage additions and a large cruciform greenhouse with attached aviary. This house was originally designed for Judge Peter Secord Lampman in 1905 by F.M. Rattenbury and built in 1907-08. P.L. James and Hubert Savage designed further additions in 1930. Includes four sets of specifications (AP119-AP122). Contractors' signatures on various plans include Leggett & Girardeau (per. H. Leggett) and Hunter & Halket (per E.J. Hunter)."

Two different proposals for additions and alterations to three-storey house with basement. The first proposal (drawings AP457-AP465), dated October 1907, calls for a new veranda and extensions to the front, right side and rear. The architect specifies stone veneer over all wall surfaces, encasing the original wood-frame structure. New interior partitioning results in the following arrangement: The first floor comprises a hall, drawing room, music room, living room, dining room, cloak room and adjoining water closet, smoking room, billiard room, safe, kitchen, pantry, larder, servants' hall, two servants' rooms and bathroom. The second floor consists of ten bedrooms, four bathrooms, boudoir, dressing room, linen room and safe. The third floor includes seven bedrooms, two bathrooms, sewing room, trunk room and balcony. The second proposal (plans AP466-AP469), dated July 1910, prescribes the addition of a two-storey wing and a three-storey wing. The finish of the additions is to match that of the old building as far as possible. This may represent the plan to turn Burleith into a luxury hotel. The first floor consists of a vestibule, hall, drawing room, music room, den, billiard room, dining room, kitchen, pantry, larder, servant's room, fifteen bedrooms, three bathrooms and three water closets. The second floor contains 26 bedrooms, dressing room, seven bathrooms and a writing room. The third floor comprises twelve bedrooms and three bathrooms."

Two different proposals for additions and alterations to three-storey house with basement. The first proposal (drawings AP457-AP465), dated October 1907, calls for a new veranda and extensions to the front, right side and rear. The architect specifies stone veneer over all wall surfaces, encasing the original wood-frame structure. New interior partitioning results in the following arrangement: The first floor comprises a hall, drawing room, music room, living room, dining room, cloak room and adjoining water closet, smoking room, billiard room, safe, kitchen, pantry, larder, servants' hall, two servants' rooms and bathroom. The second floor consists of ten bedrooms, four bathrooms, boudoir, dressing room, linen room and safe. The third floor includes seven bedrooms, two bathrooms, sewing room, trunk room and balcony. The second proposal (plans AP466-AP469), dated July 1910, prescribes the addition of a two-storey wing and a three-storey wing. The finish of the additions is to match that of the old building as far as possible. This may represent the plan to turn Burleith into a luxury hotel. The first floor consists of a vestibule, hall, drawing room, music room, den, billiard room, dining room, kitchen, pantry, larder, servant's room, fifteen bedrooms, three bathrooms and three water closets.

Two different proposals for additions and alterations to three-storey house with basement. The first proposal (drawings AP457-AP465), dated October 1907, calls for a new veranda and extensions to the front, right side and rear. The architect specifies stone veneer over all wall surfaces, encasing the original wood-frame structure. New interior partitioning results in the following arrangement: The first floor comprises a hall, drawing room, music room, living room, dining room, cloak room and adjoining water closet, smoking room, billiard room, safe, kitchen, pantry, larder, servants' hall, two servants' rooms and bathroom. The second floor consists of ten bedrooms, four bathrooms, boudoir, dressing room, linen room and safe. The third floor includes seven bedrooms, two bathrooms, sewing room, trunk room and balcony. The second proposal (plans AP466-AP469), dated July 1910, prescribes the addition of a two-storey wing and a three-storey wing. The finish of the additions is to match that of the old building as far as possible. This may represent the plan to turn Burleith into a luxury hotel. The first floor consists of a vestibule, hall, drawing room, music room, den, billiard room, dining room, kitchen, pantry, larder, servant's room, fifteen bedrooms, three bathrooms and three water closets. The second floor contains 26 bedrooms, dressing room, seven bathrooms and a writing room. The third floor comprises twelve bedrooms and three bathrooms."

Plans, elevations and details are represented in most projects. Additions to a two-storey house with basement and various new outbuildings on the grounds. A wing adds a trunk room in the basement, and a laundry on the ground floor. The roof of the latter forms a balcony off the boys' sleeping room on the second floor. Plans specify a rubble stone basement wall and wood-frame walls finished with roughcast. Another addition extends the maid's bedroom and adds a bathroom and closet over the porte cochere. Another bathroom is later added above this extension connecting with the boys' room. Two further second-floor bedrooms are added next to the boys' room (possibly above the first addition described above). A large terrace with rubble stone walls is added across the breadth of the east side of the house, and quarter-turn stairs descend from it. The terrace turns the northeast corner of the house and is surrounded by a two-storey structure next to the laundry addition. A new second-floor bedroom with lavatory and closet is built above a loggia on the ground floor or terrace level. Two sketch plans show wall, window and fireplace treatment of a living room extension. Outbuildings include five different proposals for a garden tea house, two designs for a change house, two proposals for garage additions and a large cruciform greenhouse with attached aviary. This house was originally designed for Judge Peter Secord Lampman in 1905 by F.M. Rattenbury and built in 1907-08. P.L. James and Hubert Savage designed further additions in 1930. Includes four sets of specifications (AP119-AP122). Contractors' signatures on various plans include Leggett & Girardeau (per. H. Leggett) and Hunter & Halket (per E.J. Hunter)."

This house was originally designed by D.C. Frame for George Ogilvie Leask and erected in 1910-11. Maclure prepared plans for major additions and alterations to the house. The house as altered by the first project consists of a basement and two floors. The basement includes a laundry, water closet and storeroom. The ground floor comprises a vestibule and adjoining cloak room and lavatory, stair hall, hall, drawing room, sun room, dining room, kitchen, butler's pantry and two bedrooms. A large veranda extends across the front of the house. The second floor contains five bedrooms, linen room, two bathrooms and a water closet. The alteration plans proposed in 1928 call for the construction of a flower room, play room and storeroom in the basement. The sun room on the ground floor is reconstructed and transformed into a drawing room, and the bedroom adjacent to it is converted into a den. The enlarged space on the second floor above the new drawing room becomes two bedrooms, and the two bathrooms and linen room are relocated. The contract drawings for the first alteration (AP1628-AP1635) are stamped and inscribed: ""This one of the drawings referred to in our agreement dated Nov. 12th 1925.

A wing adds a trunk room in the basement, and a laundry on the ground floor. The roof of the latter forms a balcony off the boys' sleeping room on the second floor. Plans specify a rubble stone basement wall and wood-frame walls finished with roughcast. Another addition extends the maid's bedroom and adds a bathroom and closet over the porte cochere. Another bathroom is later added above this extension connecting with the boys' room. Two further second-floor bedrooms are added next to the boys' room (possibly above the first addition described above). A large terrace with rubble stone walls is added across the breadth of the east side of the house, and quarter-turn stairs descend from it. The terrace turns the northeast corner of the house and is surrounded by a two-storey structure next to the laundry addition. A new second-floor bedroom with lavatory and closet is built above a loggia on the ground floor or terrace level. Two sketch plans show wall, window and fireplace treatment of a living room extension.

Two different proposals for additions and alterations to three-storey house with basement.

The architect specifies stone veneer over all wall surfaces, encasing the original wood-frame structure. New interior partitioning results in the following arrangement: The first floor comprises a hall, drawing room, music room, living room, dining room, cloak room and adjoining water closet, smoking room, billiard room, safe, kitchen, pantry, larder, servants' hall, two servants' rooms and bathroom. The second floor consists of ten bedrooms, four bathrooms, boudoir, dressing room, linen room and safe. The third floor includes seven bedrooms, two bathrooms, sewing room, trunk room and balcony. The second proposal (plans AP466-AP469), dated July 1910, prescribes the addition of a two-storey wing and a three-storey wing. The finish of the additions is to match that of the old building as far as possible. This may represent the plan to turn Burleith into a luxury hotel. The first floor consists of a vestibule, hall, drawing room, music room, den, billiard room, dining room, kitchen, pantry, larder, servant's room, fifteen bedrooms, three bathrooms and three water closets.

A new second-floor bedroom with lavatory and closet is built above a loggia on the ground floor or terrace level. Two sketch plans show wall, window and fireplace treatment of a living room extension. Outbuildings include five different proposals for a garden tea house, two designs for a change house, two proposals for garage additions and a large cruciform greenhouse with attached aviary.

Plans, elevations and details are represented in most projects. Additions to a two-storey house with basement and various new outbuildings on the grounds. A wing adds a trunk room in the basement, and a laundry on the ground floor. The roof of the latter forms a balcony off the boys' sleeping room on the second floor. Plans specify a rubble stone basement wall and wood-frame walls finished with roughcast. Another addition extends the maid's bedroom and adds a bathroom and closet over the porte cochere. Another bathroom is later added above this extension connecting with the boys' room. Two further second-floor bedrooms are added next to the boys' room (possibly above the first addition described above). A large terrace with rubble stone walls is added across the breadth of the east side of the house, and quarter-turn stairs descend from it. The terrace turns the northeast corner of the house and is surrounded by a two-storey structure next to the laundry addition. A new second-floor bedroom with lavatory and closet is built above a loggia on the ground floor or terrace level. Two sketch plans show wall, window and fireplace treatment of a living room extension. Outbuildings include five different proposals for a garden tea house, two designs for a change house, two proposals for garage additions and a large cruciform greenhouse with attached aviary. This house was originally designed for Judge Peter Secord Lampman in 1905 by F.M. Rattenbury and built in 1907-08. P.L. James and Hubert Savage designed further additions in 1930. Includes four sets of specifications (AP119-AP122). Contractors' signatures on various plans include Leggett & Girardeau (per. H. Leggett) and Hunter & Halket (per E.J. Hunter)."

A large terrace with rubble stone walls is added across the breadth of the east side of the house, and quarter-turn stairs descend from it. The terrace turns the northeast corner of the house and is surrounded by a two-storey structure next to the laundry addition. A new second-floor bedroom with lavatory and closet is built above a loggia on the ground floor or terrace level. Two sketch plans show wall, window and fireplace treatment of a living room extension. Outbuildings include five different proposals for a garden tea house, two designs for a change house, two proposals for garage additions and a large cruciform greenhouse with attached aviary.

Plans, elevations and details are represented in most projects. Additions to a two-storey house with basement and various new outbuildings on the grounds. A wing adds a trunk room in the basement, and a laundry on the ground floor. The roof of the latter forms a balcony off the boys' sleeping room on the second floor. Plans specify a rubble stone basement wall and wood-frame walls finished with roughcast. Another addition extends the maid's bedroom and adds a bathroom and closet over the porte cochere. Another bathroom is later added above this extension connecting with the boys' room. Two further second-floor bedrooms are added next to the boys' room (possibly above the first addition described above). A large terrace with rubble stone walls is added across the breadth of the east side of the house, and quarter-turn stairs descend from it. The terrace turns the northeast corner of the house and is surrounded by a two-storey structure next to the laundry addition. A new second-floor bedroom with lavatory and closet is built above a loggia on the ground floor or terrace level. Two sketch plans show wall, window and fireplace treatment of a living room extension. Outbuildings include five different proposals for a garden tea house, two designs for a change house, two proposals for garage additions and a large cruciform greenhouse with attached aviary. This house was originally designed for Judge Peter Secord Lampman in 1905 by F.M. Rattenbury and built in 1907-08. P.L. James and Hubert Savage designed further additions in 1930. Includes four sets of specifications (AP119-AP122). Contractors' signatures on various plans include Leggett & Girardeau (per. H. Leggett) and Hunter & Halket (per E.J. Hunter)."

Two further second-floor bedrooms are added next to the boys' room (possibly above the first addition described above). A large terrace with rubble stone walls is added across the breadth of the east side of the house, and quarter-turn stairs descend from it.

A new second-floor bedroom with lavatory and closet is built above a loggia on the ground floor or terrace level. Two sketch plans show wall, window and fireplace treatment of a living room extension.

This house was originally designed by D.C. Frame for George Ogilvie Leask and erected in 1910-11. Maclure prepared plans for major additions and alterations to the house. The house as altered by the first project consists of a basement and two floors. The basement includes a laundry, water closet and storeroom. The ground floor comprises a vestibule and adjoining cloak room and lavatory, stair hall, hall, drawing room, sun room, dining room, kitchen, butler's pantry and two bedrooms. A large veranda extends across the front of the house. The second floor contains five bedrooms, linen room, two bathrooms and a water closet. The alteration plans proposed in 1928 call for the construction of a flower room, play room and storeroom in the basement. The sun room on the ground floor is reconstructed and transformed into a drawing room, and the bedroom adjacent to it is converted into a den. The enlarged space on the second floor above the new drawing room becomes two bedrooms, and the two bathrooms and linen room are relocated.

"1 of 34 drawings: 17 pencil on paper, 1 pencil & ink on paper, 11 ink on paper, 4 ink on linen, 1 blueprint; 55 x 84 cm or smaller "	architectural drawings AAT		english	"Drawings for different projects ranging from proposal sketches to working drawings and a consultant's plan. Plans, elevations and details are represented in most projects. Additions to a two-storey house with basement and various new outbuildings on the grounds. A wing adds a trunk room in the basement, and a laundry on the ground floor. The roof of the latter forms a balcony off the boys' sleeping room on the second floor. Plans specify a rubble stone basement wall and wood-frame walls finished with roughcast. Another addition extends the maid's bedroom and adds a bathroom and closet over the porte cochere. Another bathroom is later added above this extension connecting with the boys' room. Two further second-floor bedrooms are added next to the boys' room (possibly above the first addition described above). A large terrace with rubble stone walls is added across the breadth of the east side of the house, and quarter-turn stairs descend from it. The terrace turns the northeast corner of the house and is surrounded by a two-storey structure next to the laundry addition. A new second-floor bedroom with lavatory and closet is built above a loggia on the ground floor or terrace level. Two sketch plans show wall, window and fireplace treatment of a living room extension. Outbuildings include five different proposals for a garden tea house, two designs for a change house, two proposals for garage additions and a large cruciform greenhouse with attached aviary. This house was originally designed for Judge Peter Secord Lampman in 1905 by F.M. Rattenbury and built in 1907-08. P.L. James and Hubert Savage designed further additions in 1930. Includes four sets of specifications (AP119-AP122). Contractors' signatures on various plans include Leggett & Girardeau (per. H. Leggett) and Hunter & Halket (per E.J. Hunter)."
